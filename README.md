# chatApp

## Overview
This project demonstrates a chat application that utilizes Kafka for message brokering and Apache Flink for real-time stream processing. The application filters and processes chat messages, generates warnings for sensitive content, and routes the processed data to various Kafka topics.

## Kafka Topics Configuration
Topics
1. processed-data: Holds processed chat messages that have been filtered by Flink's data stream processing.
2. chat-data: The initial entry point for incoming chat messages.
3. warning-data: Carries warning alerts generated by the application when a user sends more sensitive messages than the threshold allows (more than 3 sensitive messages in 1 minute).
